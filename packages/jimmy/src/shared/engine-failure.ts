/**
 * What an engine's failure prose actually says.
 *
 * Three places used to answer this question with their own regex set — the
 * rate-limit detector, the workflow retry boundary, and the respawn auth guard —
 * and they disagreed with each other in ways that were load-bearing rather than
 * accidental. "overloaded" is a quota window to one of them and an upstream
 * fault to another, and both readings are correct: the provider is saying two
 * things at once.
 *
 * So a classification here is a SET, not a verdict. This module says which
 * signals the text carries; each consumer keeps its own reading of them.
